# 027-Apple-Watch-App-Color-Game

![][] **Description**: a color game made for Apple Watch.
**Features**:

-   Easy to play color game, just choose the right matching colors and
you’ll get a score increase
-   Use force touch to trigger the menu to stop game, check scores or
set the playing time

**Notes**:

-   It’s a known problem that the watch app runs quite slowly. I tried
to incorporate framework, but it just slows down the app a lot. And
sometimes, it stops at the loading screen.
-   I also tried to pay a “Show Score” button at the first screen,
ironically half the time the app will stop at the loading screen. So
I moved it to settings
-   I realized that I had some spelling problem with the app, too much
waiting for the loading screen to change, so I just let it go.
